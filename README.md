### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Matt-A-Thompson
- I'm a **PhD student** in the Mechanical Engineering department at **University College London, UK**.

- Iâ€™m interested in developing molecular modelling methods, particularly <a href="https://www.cp2k.org">CP2K</a>, as well as other MM programs.

- Iâ€™m currently working on methods to further understand materials used in green hydrogen production, as well as creating workflows for bulk molecular modelling jobs.

- I also maintain the <a href="https://github.com/Matt-A-Thompson/PyRTP">**PyRTP**</a> code (https://github.com/Matt-A-Thompson/PyRTP), a simple-to-use, Python-based DFT and RT-TDDFT program for teaching and fast research testing.
  
- If you'd like to help with PyRTP or any other projects, let me know!

- The best way to reach me is via email: matthew.thompson.24@ucl.ac.uk
