### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Matt-A-Thompson
- I'm a **Graduate Researcher** in Computational Physics at the **University of Lincoln, UK**.

- Iâ€™m interested in Time Dependent Density Functional Theory methods, CP2K and other MM programs.

- Iâ€™m currently working on **PyRTP** (https://github.com/Matt-A-Thompson/PyRTP), a simple-to-use, Python-based DFT and RT-TDDFT program for teaching and fast research testing.
  
- If you'd like to help with PyRTP or any similar projects, let me know!

- The best way to reach me is via email: MatThompson@lincoln.ac.uk
